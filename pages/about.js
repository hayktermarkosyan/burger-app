      <p>
        Fat burgers are good old burgers according to the classic recipe, the
        right size and at a reasonable price.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are prepared in American, Mexican and Italian manners, sparing no
        sauce and toppings.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who are pretty hungry, there is an immense «Fattest Burger»
        with five beef cutlets, corn chips and cheese.
